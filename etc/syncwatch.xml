    <!--
	This xml file described the syncronizations to be done.
	
	Add a sync to syncs to add a synchronization. You can name it anything you like. e.g. mybackup:
	<mybackup>
		...
 	</mybackup>

	The parameters per sync can be modified: 
	    <enabled> enables or disables this syns job. Default is true, optional parameter
		<source> is the source folder, obligated
		<destination> is the destination folder, obligated
		<delay> defines the delay between writing something to the source folder 
						and starting to sync in seconds. This is to prevent syncing while still 
						writing data. Default is 10 seconds.
		<resettimer> defines whether to reset the timer (start the delay again) when writing 
					 	data during the delay time. Default is true.
		<initsync> defines whether to sync on the program start. Default is false.
		<reversesync> defines whether to sync to source when a file or folder on the target changes.
						Default is false.
		<retry> defines whether to keep retrying setting up a connection, e.g. when source or destination
  						is not mounted (yet). Retry is done silent with a 10 second delay. Default is false.
		The following options are all rsync options. The a (archive) option is always added.
		<delete> defines whether to delete file on the destination (see rsync delete). Default is true.
		<exclude> defines patterns to be excluded from syncing (see rsync exclude). Multiple patterns
						should be comma separated. Default is empty.
		<include> defines patterns to be included in syncing (see rsync include). Multiple patterns
						should be comma separated. Default is empty.
		<compress> defines whether to compress files to be synced (see rsync compress). Default is true.
		<update> defines whether to update files to be synced (see rsync update). Default is true.
		<options> defines options added to rsync (see rsync manual). Multiple patterns may be comma
						separated. Contents is not checked. Default is empty.
