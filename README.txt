SyncWatch v0.8.3

SyncWatch service to synchronize 2 locations on file or folder change
========= ======= == =========== = ========= == ==== == ====== ======

SyncWatch uses rsync to synchronize files and folders automatically on changes in the source folder.

2 way synchronization (reversesync) is possible.

This program can run as systemd service or as stand-alone program.
As systemd service it starts after rc.local, assuming every location is mounted at this time.

The service is completely configurable via syncwatch.xml, located in /etc/syncwatch.xml.

The xml file described the syncronizations to be done.
	
Add a sync to syncs to add a synchronization. You can name it anything you like. e.g. mybackup:
<mybackup>
	...
</mybackup>

The parameters per sync can be modified: 
	<source> is the source folder, obligated
	<destination> is the destination folder, obligated
	<delay> defines the delay between writing something to the source folder 
					and starting to sync in seconds. This is to prevent syncing while still 
					writing data. Default is 10 seconds.
	<resettimer> defines whether to reset the timer (start the delay again) when writing 
				 	data during the delay time. Default is true.
	<initsync> defines whether to sync on the program start. Default is false.
	<reversesync> defines whether to sync to source when a file or folder on the target changes.
					Default is false.
	<retry> defines whether to keep retrying setting up a connection, e.g. when source or destination
  					is not mounted (yet). Retry is done silent with a 10 second delay. Default is false.
	The following options are all rsync options. The a (archive) option is always added.
	<delete> defines whether to delete file on the destination (see rsync delete). Default is true.
	<exclude> defines patterns to be excluded from syncing (see rsync exclude). Multiple patterns
					should be comma separated. Default is empty.
	<include> defines patterns to be included in syncing (see rsync include). Multiple patterns
					should be comma separated. Default is empty.
	<compress> defines whether to compress files to be synced (see rsync compress). Default is true.
	<update> defines whether to update files to be synced (see rsync update). Default is true.
	<options> defines options added to rsync (see rsync manual). Multiple patterns may be comma
					separated. Contents is not checked. Default is empty.

That's all for now ...
